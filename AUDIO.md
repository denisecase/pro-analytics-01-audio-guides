# Audio File (Podcast Format) 

The setup instructions are available in audio (podcast) format for those who prefer listening and learning.

## Built with NotebookLM

Audio Guides were created for free using [Google NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/).

## Converted from WAV to MP3

Google NotebookLM generates the audio as a `.wav` file.  
To optimize for size and compatibility, it was converted to `.mp3` using the free [Online Audio Converter](https://online-audio-converter.com/).
